[Reactive Swift](https://github.com/reactivecocoa/reactiveswift) is the new ReactiveCocoa but without the Cocoa bits (nibs?). It‚Äôs a [Functional Reactive Programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754) framework for Swift. It‚Äôs [awesome](https://github.com/kickstarter/ios-oss). It can make your code declarative, [simple](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) and way less stateful. It can handle things that normally need a bunch of `if`s and `bool` state, in just a handful of lines. It‚Äôs incredibly concise. It can allow you to have your views update automatically when new stuff is fetched from your backend, without any extra code. It can make your code easier to test. It‚Äôs designed to handle things happening over time. It handles multithreading better than your grandma‚Äôs knitting circle.

But, when you ihavenoideawhatimdoing.jpg, it can also turn your codebase into convoluted stinking pile of üí©

This series of posts is designed to ease you into FRP with ReactiveSwift. I‚Äôm not going to start with a reactive login screen (FRP‚Äôs TodoMVC). We‚Äôre going to break it down to the basic primitives man, and build up from there. I‚Äôm going to try and explain the how and the why, not just the what. Hopefully, you‚Äôre going to skip the usual first step of the FRP n00b, which is to Reactive `allthethings!` and then do a rewrite.

I‚Äôm also going to assume you‚Äôre [fluent in Swift 3](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/). And you have a clone of the [Reactive Swift repo](https://github.com/reactivecocoa/reactiveswift), with the playground fired up and ready for action. Ready? Let‚Äôs go!

## Signals, Events, Values, say whaaat?
Let‚Äôs say you want to send an `Int` somewhere. In ReactiveSwift speak, that `Int` is a value. This value is sent as an `Event` via an `Observer`, which emits it on a `Signal`. Anything interested in this `Int` should be observing the other end of this `Signal` to receive it.

Makes sense. Kinda sounds like a regular delegate pattern with different nomenclature. What does it look like in `code`?

First we create a `Signal` and it's corresponding `Observer`. These guys are best buddies. A `Signal` will always have a corresponding `Observer`, either explicitly or implicitly. When you manually create them they are known together as a `pipe`:

`let pipe = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()`

The `pipe` is a tuple consisting of an `input` (the `Observer`) and an `output` (the `Signal`). `Signal`s and `Observer`s are generics, and in this case we specialise them to work with `Int` values and no error handling, for now. More on errors later.

Then we observe the `Int` values emitted on the `Signal`  by attaching a closure to it:

```
pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	print("ü§ñ Johnny \(value) is alive!")
}
```

Now, every time an `Int` is emitted on the `Signal` this `observeValues` closure is fired with it as the `value`.

Finally, to emit our `Int`, we send it to the `Observer` object:

`pipe.input.send(value: 5)`

The `Observer` emits `5` on the `Signal` as a value `Event` (more on `Event`s later), arriving at our observation closure. The direct result of the above line being executed is the `observeValues` closure being fired with the `5` as the value.

All together now:

```
let pipe = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()

pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	print("ü§ñ Johnny \(value) is alive!")
}

pipe.input.send(value: 5)
```

Copy/paste this into the sandbox playground and play around with it. Try extra `pipe.input.send` lines, changing the value sent for each. You‚Äôll see in the debug console that the block is fired exactly once with each value received in the order we sent them.

So the cool thing about `Signal`s is that they can be observed by any number of closures. So the value of one `send(value:)` can be received and used in many different ways and contexts.

```
let pipe = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()

pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	print("I got \(value) problems but a üèñ ain't one")
}

pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	UIPasteboard.general.string = "\(value)"
}

pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	UserDefaults.standard.set(value: value, forKey: "Luftbaloons")
}

pipe.input.send(value: 99)
```

Neat. But what if we want to stop observing a `Signal`? In a normal delegate pattern situation we‚Äôd simply `nil` the `.delegate`. In a multicast delegate situation we‚Äôd have a `func` to call to remove an individual delegate. In the world of ReactiveSwift where there is no distinct object but rather a single closure, we need a more fine grained construct. This is where `Disposable` comes in. Each time you observe a `Signal`, you get a `Disposable` in return.

```
let pipe = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()

let problemsDisposable = pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	print("I got \(value) problems but a üèñ ain't one")
}

let beersDisposable = pipe.output.observeValues { value in
	print("\(value) bottles of üç∫ on the wall, \(value) bottles of üçª")
}

pipe.input.send(value: 99)
problemsDisposable.dispose()
pipe.input.send(value: 98)
```

When you call `dispose()` on a `Disposable` it disconnects the observing closure from the `Signal` and it no longer fires.

Already this is pretty cool and we‚Äôre barely scratching the surface. We basically have a multicast delegate pattern in a handful of lines, without custom protocols üòé

## A Series of Unfortunate Events
But there‚Äôs more to `Signal`s than just transmitting values. They can also fail, or be interrupted, or complete. The `Event` `enum` is used to represent all these events. When you `.observe` a `Signal`, you‚Äôre really observing the `Event`s being emitted on that `Signal`. The `.observeValues` is a convenience which allows us to only pay attention to the `Event.value` events - in our case above, the `Int` values. Let‚Äôs take a look at the other `Event` `case`s.

Firstly, `.failed`. Funnily enough, this is used to represent something that has gone wrong üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. This has an `Error` type associated value. This gives us strongly typed and declarative error messaging. But there‚Äôs more to it. If a `Signal` receives a `.failed` `Event`, it will stop emitting any further `Event`s. So this is used if we encounter a situation where we cannot continue and need to inform anything observing the `Signal` what went wrong.

```
enum NumberError: Error {
    case nonLyrical
}

let pipe = Signal<Int, NumberError>.pipe()

pipe.output.observe { event in
    switch event {
    case let .value(value):
        print("I got \(value) problems but a üèñ ain't one")
    case let .failed(error) where error == .nonLyrical:
        print("Bro, do you even Jay Z?")
    default:
        break
    }
}

pipe.input.send(value: 99)
pipe.input.send(value: 10)
pipe.input.send(error: .nonLyrical)
pipe.input.send(value: 99)
```

Notice that the last value (99) didn't send, because the `Signal` had received `.failed` . Perfect. Sidenote: normally we would use an operator to detect that `10` isn‚Äôt lyrical and automatically fail. More on this later.

Next we have `.completed`. This also causes the `Signal` to stop, but without an `Error`. It is generally used to indicate success - the `Signal` has finished without issue and we don't need it anymore.

```
let pipe = Signal<Int, NoError>.pipe()

pipe.output.observe { event in
    switch event {
    case let .value(value):
        print("And a \(value)")
    case let .completed:
        print("üî•üíÉüï∫‚ö°Ô∏è")
    default:
        break
    }
}

print("On the count of 3, show me your best dance moves")
pipe.input.send(value: 1)
pipe.input.send(value: 2)
pipe.input.send(value: 3)
pipe.input.sendCompleted()
```

Sidenote: As above, we would normally use an operator to detect `1`, `2` and `3` had been emitted in the right order and then automatically complete.

Finally there‚Äôs `.interrupted`, which is very similar to `.completed` but is used to simply stop the `Signal` rather than indicate success. This might not seem useful right now, but when we get into operators and chaining it will become clearer. As an example, pretend a `Signal` could be used to process an array of images[^1], but during processing the user leaves the screen. The `Signal` should stop work, but it didn‚Äôt complete nor did it error. It has been interrupted. This way, the app can clean up anything being used for image processing but leave out the success path that would have shown an alert or something. Without `bool`s or state üíØ

In each case above where the `Signal` stops (`.failed`, `.completed`, and `.interrupted`), it will not emit any further `Event`s even if its `Observer` attempts to. So if we're clumsy with our code and try to send a `.value` `Event` after a `Signal` has completed, it won't send - the `Signal` is already stopped. It also won‚Äôt throw an exception or anything.

And one last note about manually created `Signal`s (like we do above with `.pipe`): if they still have active observers (closures that haven‚Äôt been disposed), they won‚Äôt `deinit` until they receive `.completed`, `.failed` or `.interrupted`. It‚Äôs really important to check your `Signal`s `deinit` correctly when you‚Äôre starting out.
